# Automata-Planner

Simple tool for making cellular automata with arbitrary 2D geometry.

Hold control and click to build a cell from vertices.

Hold shift and drag between cells to assign neighbors.

Press spacebar to run and pause the simulation.

Currently only simulates Conway's Game of Life rules, but the rule set is a simple dictionary in the Global object.
